I enjoy speaking at conferences and meetups to share my thoughts and ideas on software &mdash; particularly open source, iOS, Swift, and Objective-C. You can find the materials and details for all of my talks [on GitHub](https://github.com/jessesquires/talks) and all of my slides [on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/jessesquires).

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:jesse@jessesquires.com) about speaking at your event!
