---

I'm a software developer in Oakland, California. I'm primarily an iOS developer, though I have other programming interests. My open source projects are on [GitHub]({{ site.social_links.github}}) and my iOS libraries are on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/owners/1808). My side projects can be found at [Hexed Bits](https://hexedbits.com). I started the [Swift Weekly Brief](https://swiftweekly.github.io) newsletter before handing it off to the community and I co-host the [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped) podcast. I'm currently an iOS developer at [PlanGrid](https://plangrid.com). Previously, I've worked at [Instagram](https://instagram.com) and [Rosetta Stone](https://rosettastone.com).

**Other interests:** barefoot trail running, body modification, tea, coffee, cognitive science, vegetarianism, moral philosophy, avant-garde art, punk/hardcore/metal

More generally, I'm motivated to [build worker power](https://www.techworkerscoalition.org) and I hope to contribute to a society that values community over hierarchy, [self-determination over capitalist exploitation](https://crimethinc.com/tce), and public ownership over private property.
