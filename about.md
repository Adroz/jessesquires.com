title: About
---

I'm a software developer in Oakland, California. I'm passionate about mobile computing, open source, and coffee.
My interests include software design patterns and architecture, cognitive science, moral philosophy, and avant-garde art. I believe in [political resistance](http://crimethinc.com/tce/). I enjoy barefoot trail running and body modification. I like my coffee like my metal &mdash; **black**. When I'm not working or running, you can find me at punk and metal shows in the Bay Area.
