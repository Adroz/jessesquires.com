XKCD's posts on [saving time](http://xkcd.com/1205/) and [automation](http://xkcd.com/1319/) are precisely how this blog came to be. Until now, I never had the time or motivation to write on a regular basis, though I considered it often. I've been increasingly involved in the Objective-C open-source community via [GitHub](https://github.com/jessesquires) and [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), and was lucky enough to attend [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc) this year for its 25th anniversary. And with that, the time has come for me to starting writing about interesting things.

For this site, I did not want a *blogspot* or *tumblr* or *wordpress* site. I wanted to build a site and manage it myself. I wanted control and I wanted it to be made as simple as possible, [but no simpler](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein). And I wanted it to be open-source.

This world would be significantly different without the concept of [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), an idea that has been around for millenia (though not referred to as "open-source" until more recently). Only through the processes of sharing, [collaboration](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/origins/2009/09/on-the-origin-of-cooperation.html), and [reciprocity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130820094643.htm) did our ancestors establish a stable, thriving society. So much of the software in-use today was built on top of, or written with the help of [open-source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), and it would be naive to think that the different technologies and apps that we take for granted every single day would be here without that help.

This site is lovingly powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), and it is generously hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) &mdash; *all of which are built on and influenced by open-source*.

**Future posts will focus on iOS, Objective-C, Swift, and open-source.**
