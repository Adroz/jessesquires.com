I'm excited to share that my good friend and talented artist, [Lisa Sy](https://www.lisasy.com), and I have released a new sticker pack for iMessage! It is based on her excellent web comic, [*plurals and noun*](https://pluralsandnoun.com) &mdash; a comic about queer and weird things that happen. It's free and you can [**download it here**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plurals-and-noun/id1479649555).

We had this idea a few months ago, and put this together over the last two weeks. It was super fun to collaborate together on this project &mdash; and now, share it with you! The stickers look great and perfectly capture the vibe of the comic, as well as reference [some of my favorite panels](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgbupphDzcx/).

If you aren't already, you should follow *plurals and noun* ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/pluralsandnoun), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pluralsandnoun/), [Web](https://pluralsandnoun.com)). It is one of the best web comics out there. And of course, follow Lisa ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/lisasy), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lisasyart/), [Web](https://www.lisasy.com)). If you like the stickers, consider [buying a print from her shop](https://lisasy.bigcartel.com)!
