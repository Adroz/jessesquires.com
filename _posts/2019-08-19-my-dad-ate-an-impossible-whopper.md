I've been eating vegetarian (and often vegan) for a decade now. I don't talk about it much. This is a choice I've made for myself and my own reasons. What I never imagined happening is the growing popularity and wide availability of vegan/vegetarian food. It is simply *remarkable*.

<!--excerpt-->

**Two** major fast food chains &mdash; White Castle and Burger King &mdash; now serve [The Impossible Burger](https://impossiblefoods.com), which honestly feels fucking impossible to believe. I never would have thought that would happen 10 years ago.

Even more unbelievable to me is the text message I received today from my (68-year-old) Dad.

> *"Just tried Burger Kingâ€™s Impossible Burger which is soy based. It was great. Jess, youâ€™d be proud."*

Holy shit. This is awesome. I knew the Impossible Whopper recently came out, but I never talked with him about it, nor encouraged him to try it. **He sought this out this on his own.** (It's also cute that he told me "it's soy based" like I didn't know that already. ðŸ˜‚) Of course, I congratulated him and said I was proud. He followed up with: *"It was really good and has a few less calories. If you didnâ€™t know you were eating a soy burger, you wouldnâ€™t be able to tell the difference."*

Let that sink in. In 2019, you can go to middle America and **eat vegan** and **like it**. Making *The Impossible* an option is great, but I think **making it familiar** to folks like my Dad is why it will (hopefully) be successful.

However, it presents an interesting moral dilemma. Fast food corporations (like all capitalist corporations) are the fucking enemy &mdash; especially when it comes to veganism. They profit from the commoditization of cheap meat and animal cruelty, and helped the commercial food industry lobby for "the food pyramid" that [we now know was total bullshit](http://twistedfood.co.uk/why-everything-you-know-about-the-food-pyramid-is-a-lie/). Meat production has a significant [negative impact on the environment](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/01/commission-report-great-food-transformation-plant-diet-climate-change/), and they don't care. But now these companies are making vegan food accessible! And people like my Dad &mdash; who do not live in a place like the Bay Area where there is an abundance of vegan food, who have never been that interested in trying vegan food &mdash; are not only trying it, but liking it!

Life under capitalism is full of contradictions. Do I want to support Burger King and White Castle? Hell no. Do I want to support Impossible and the proliferation, popularity, and accessibility of good vegan alternatives to meat? Fuck yes. It's an awkward position to be in and a strange phenomenon to witness. While it's a bit uncomfortable to admit, I've had the Impossible burger at both places and it was damn good.
