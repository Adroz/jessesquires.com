title: The Tor Browser
---

I've known about the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en) for a long time, but I guess it's been awhile. ðŸ˜… The last time I was actively using Tor was with [Vidalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidalia_(software)), which was apparently [discontinued](https://blog.torproject.org/plain-vidalia-bundles-be-discontinued-dont-panic) about 5 to 6 years ago. Ha! Whoops.

Today I learned that the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) is a thing. Specifically, the thing that replaced Vidalia. Pretty cool. It's a fork of [FireFox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/), which is also pretty rad. The Tor Browser seems like a massive improvement for users who aren't very tech savvy.

These are the kinds of open source projects that inspire me and keep me hopeful. Easy-to-use, free (as in beer *and* as in speech), with the sole purpose of protecting people. And funded as 501(c)(3) non-profit.

I never imagined that such vast amounts of popular software would become actively harmful like they are today, but that's a topic for another post. Today, I'm appreciative that there exists software that's trying *hard* to be **actively helpful**.
