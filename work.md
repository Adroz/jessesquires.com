You can find my complete and up-to-date résumé on [LinkedIn]({{ site.social_links.linkedin }}). My open source projects are on [GitHub]({{ site.social_links.github}}) and you can see the impact that my work has on the community at my [CocoaPods author page](https://cocoapods.org/owners/1808). My side projects can be found at [Hexed Bits](http://hexedbits.com). I also curate the [*Swift Weekly Brief*](https://swiftweekly.github.io) newsletter, and co-host [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped).
